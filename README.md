This repository contains all scripts used for the paper "Early White Matter Microstructure Alterations in Infants with Down Syndrome", for reproducibility purposes. 

Overview: 
This repository is organized into four main components labelled: Preliminary QC, Final QC, Atlas Mapping and Fiber Processing 

Before diving into the four components, note that DICOMs are first converted to .nrrd format using DWIConvert_4.6.0. 
The specific script used is not necessary for reproducibility and is therefore not included — you may use any tool of your choice to complete this conversion. 

----

PRELIM_QC: After obtaining .nrrd files, a preliminary quality control (QC) step is performed for each subject 
- 101_AP and 101_PA are checked using 3D Slicer 5.6.2 
- 101_PA_B0 is checked using DTIPrep 1.2.8 

During this step, the number of gradients, artifacts, and motion are assessed. Subjects are excluded if: 
- Fewer than 70% of gradients remain 
- There is a severe reference image artifact or significant motion in the cerebrum 

Two scripts are run after preliminary QC:  

2_dmriprep.script -> Performs automated QC, eddy current correction, susceptibility correction, and generates QC tractography. It creates a dmriprep_0.5.7 folder per passing subject. 
This script calls the following as well:  
   - Run_dmriprep_convert_wrapper.script 
   - Run_dmriprep_tract_wrapper.script 
   - Run_dmriprep_wrapper.script 

3_DWIMask_NIRAL.script  -> Creates low-shell DWI images (for tensor computation) and generates automated DWI brain masks. Final output is a subject-specific Brainmask_0.5.7 folder. 

Automated brain masks are then reviewed and manually corrected using ITK-SNAP 4.0.2. 

----

FINAL_QC: Final QC is conducted after the dmriprep_0.5.7 folder is generated for each subject.  
- Brain tracts are reviewed using 3D Slicer 5.6.2 
- Poor-quality gradients are manually removed from the full set of 101 gradients using dmriprep 
- Presence and extent of the arc artifact in the temporal and frontal lobes 

Subjects are excluded at this stage if: 
- Brain tracts show major interruptions 
- More than 30% of gradients must be removed 
- Frontal lobe is impacted by the temporal arc artifact 

After Final QC, two scripts are executed: 

4_MoreQCstats.script -> Computes motion stat csv 

5_NODDI.script -> Computes NODDI maps (creates AMICO folders for subjects) 
   - Calls Run_AMICO_wrapper.script

----

ATLAS_MAPPING : Two scripts are executed

2_MapOtherDataInAtlas.script -> Maps all data into DTI atlas with tracts 
   
3_MapNODDItoAtlas.script -> Maps all NODDI data into atlas 

----

FIBER_PROCESSING : Five scripts are executed

dtitractstat.script -> Generates fiber profiles for DTI maps 

dtitractstat_NODDI.script -> Generates fiber profiles for NODDI maps 

GatherCSV_NODDI.script -> Generates CSV for NODDI maps   
   - Calls RunGather.script 
   
GatherCSV.script -> Generates CSV for DTI profiles  
   - Calls RunGather.script 
     
RunCompute_oazrak.script -> Computes tract averages for subjects 

----

ARC ARTIFACT Details: The arc artifact was present at varying severities across subjects. It was either absent, limited to the temporal region, or extended from the temporal into the prefrontal region. To correct for this artifact, the affected region was manually segmented in 10 subjects using ITK-SNAP. This mask was then propagated to the DWI atlas for the entire sample. As noted earlier, subjects were excluded if the arc artifact was severe and extended into the prefrontal region during Final QC.

We then identified which tracts intersected the arc artifact mask. Any segments of affected tracts were cropped during the fiber profile cropping step. This cropping was applied to all subjects—regardless of whether their individual scans showed the artifact—to ensure consistency in fiber profile length across the cohort, allowing for valid group comparisons.

The tracts affected included the tapetum of the corpus callosum, bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculi, bilateral fornices, and bilateral uncinate fasciculi. Cropping details are outlined below.
